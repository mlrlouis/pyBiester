## About The Project

**pyBiester** is an intelligent, autonomous bot designed to compete in a multiplayer environment inspired by **Agar.io**.

Developed as part of the "Programming 3" module at the **Technical University of Applied Sciences Augsburg**, our team engineered the decision-making logic (the "Brain") for an agent within a provided game framework. The goal was to develop algorithms that maximize point accumulation while simultaneously ensuring survival against rival bots in a competitive arena.

### Key Achievements
* **Ranked 3rd** out of 20 competing teams.
* **Quality Assurance:** Implemented comprehensive automated tests using **pytest** to validate game logic and identify critical edge cases before deployment.
* **Logic Validation:** Conducted code reviews to detect and fix algorithmic errors in the decision-making process.

## Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python
* **Testing Framework:** `pytest`
* **Concepts:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Vector Mathematics, Collision Detection.
